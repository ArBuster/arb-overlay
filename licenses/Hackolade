13. Infringement Indemnification
(a) Hackolade will defend, indemnify, hold Licensee and its directors, officers, employees and other agents (collectively, �Licensee Indemnitees�) harmless, at Hackolade�s sole cost and expense, any action brought against any Licensee Indemnitee based upon the claim that the Product, if used within the scope of the License granted under this Agreement, infringes, violates, or misappropriates a patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, or other intellectual property or proprietary right (�IP Claim�); provided, however, that: (i) Licensee shall notify Hackolade promptly in writing of any such IP Claim; (ii) Licensee shall not enter into any settlement or compromise on any IP Claim without Hackolade�s prior written consent; (iii) Hackolade shall have sole control of any such action and settlement negotiations so long as there is no detriment or liability to Licensee; and (iv) Licensee shall provide Hackolade with reasonable information and assistance, at Hackolade�s request and sole cost and expense, necessary to settle, defend, indemnify or hold harmless such IP Claim. Hackolade agrees to pay all damages and costs incurred Licensee attributable to such IP Claim. The foregoing states the sole liability of Hackolade and the exclusive remedy of Licensee for any infringement of intellectual property rights by the Product or any other items provided by Hackolade hereunder.

(b) If the Product becomes, or in the opinion of Hackolade may become, the subject of a claim of infringement of any third party right, Hackolade may, at its option and in its discretion promptly: (i) procure for Licensee the right to use the Product free of any liability; (ii) replace or modify the Product to make it noninfringing; or (iii) refund any License Fees related to this Product paid by Licensee.

(c) Exclusions from Defense Obligation. Hackolade will have no duty to defend any IP Claim to the extent such IP Claim is based on: (i) use of a superseded release of the Product, if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of a current release of the Product and Hackolade timely notified Licensee of the availability of the non-infringing Product at no additional cost; (ii) the combination, operation, or use of the Product with programs or data not furnished by Hackolade or at Hackolade�s direction, or with hardware or operating system software other than the hardware platform and operating system with which the Product is designed to function, if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Product without such programs, data, hardware or operating systems; (iii) modification or attempted modification of the Product by anyone except Hackolade or at Hackolade�s direction, or use or distributions of such modifications; or (iv) Licensee�s use of the Product in a manner that results in defamation, violates the privacy rights of individuals, transmits material in violation of any applicable law, rule, regulation, or uses any proprietary thirty party content without legally binding consent of such third party.

(d) To the extent an IP Claim is excluded from Hackolade�s defense obligation, is based upon the claim that any modifications to the Product or combination of the Product with products, not provided by Hackolade or at Hackolade�s direction, infringes or violates any third party, Licensee will defend or settle, at its expense, any action brought against Hackolade provided, however, that: (i) Hackolade shall notify Licensee promptly in writing of any such claim; (ii) Hackolade shall not enter into any settlement or compromise any such claim without Licensee�s prior written consent; (iii) Licensee shall have sole control of any such action and settlement negotiations; and (iv) Hackolade shall provide Licensee with information and assistance, at Licensee�s request and expense, necessary to settle or defend such claim. Licensee agrees to pay all damages and costs finally awarded against Hackolade attributable to such claim. Hackolade may elect to assume control of the defense and settlement of any such claim with counsel of its choosing; provided however, that if Licensee will not have breached its defense and settlement obligations hereunder, Licensee will have no obligation to pay the costs and expenses of such Hackolade-controlled defense or settlement. The foregoing states the sole liability of Licensee and the exclusive remedy of Hackolade for any infringement of intellectual property rights by the Licensee modifications or combinations or any other items provided by Licensee hereunder.

(e) Notwithstanding Clause 13(a) above, Hackolade assumes no liability hereunder for, and shall have no obligation to defend Licensee or to pay costs, damages or attorney's fees for, any claim based upon any modifications to any of the Product not approved by Hackolade or at Hackolade�s direction or combination of any of the Product with products not approved by Hackolade or at Hackolade�s direction.

14. Limitation of Liability
Excluding Hackolade�s indemnification obligations described in Clause 13 hereof, neither party hereto will be liable to any third-party for any loss, damage, cost, expense or other claim (including consequential, directly, indirect, special, punitive or other damages and loss of data or profits) in relation to this Agreement or the Product including, without limitation: (a) any use or reliance on a Product by the third-party (including the form and content of errors in and/or omissions from any information contained in a Product); (b) any delay, interruption or other failure in the provision of the Product; or (c) any change in the form or content of the Product. Excluding Hackolade indemnification obligations described in Clause 13 hereof, in no event will either party�s liability under any claims arising out of this Agreement exceed the fees paid by Licensee under this Agreement. Except for each party's indemnification obligations or breach of Clause 2 (�Licensee Fee�), 8 (�Unauthorized Use or Distribution�), or 10 (�Licensee�s Restrictions�), neither party will be liable for lost profits or for special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages, regardless of the form of action, even if such party is advised of or aware of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing liability limitations shall apply to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law. To the extent the foregoing liability limitations or the warranty disclaimers of Clause 4 are not allowed by applicable law, then the liability of Hackolade, and the remedy of Licensee, shall be limited to the prompt: (d) re-supply of any defective Product; or (e) refund of any license fees paid by Licensee for such defective Product.

Confirmation of such denial (via reply email) must be received prior to downloading for this exclusion to be effective.

(c) Should the Licensee come to be or already be included on Hackolade's website or in Product promotional material, as a result of any prior purchases where the Licensee did not request exclusion from Product promotional material, the Licensee can at any point in time, submit a written request via email to info@hackolade.com to have Hackolade remove the Licensee's name from Product promotional material.
